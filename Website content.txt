Why choose me?
I started learning karnatic music at the age of 6 and continued meticulous training  for over a decade. Under the guidance of my teacher, I crafted many compositions and won musical contests. I furthered my learning in various Vaishnava bhajans . This led me to also learn indian classical instruments such as harmonium and mridanga. 
I have been teaching these songs and techniques to students of all age groups for the past 6 -7 years.

My story
	My Karnatic Odyssey: A Symphony of Heritage and Harmony 

At the tender age of five, the seeds of Karnatic music were sown in my heart by my mother, an esteemed maestra of classical melodies. Her guidance was the first note in my lifelong sonata. By seven, my musical voyage took a transformative turn under the tutelage of a profoundly dedicated mentor, who reshaped my understanding and appreciation of this art form.

Over a decade of meticulous learning, I honed my vocal prowess, crafted original compositions, and triumphed in numerous musical contests. Yet, my exploration extended beyond the conventional boundaries as I delved into the devotional depths of Vaishnava bhajans, penned by the revered acharyas of the Gaudiya tradition. This spiritual sojourn led me to master the harmonium, mridangam, and kartals, further enriching my repertoire.

The rhythm of my journey resonated through the halls of kirtan melas and ISKCON assemblies, where I had the privilege to offer my voice in sacred song. Six to seven years ago, I embarked on a new chapter as an educator, sharing the divine verses of bhajans with eager learners of all ages.

Now, I stand ready to cast the net of knowledge across the vast ocean of music, inviting all who yearn to immerse themselves in its boundless beauty. Join me, and together, letâ€™s navigate the melodious waves of Karnatic music.
